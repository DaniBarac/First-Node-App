# First Node App

This is the first web application I created using Node with Express. It is not made with any purpose in mind other than as a place to experiment and try out web-related ideas.

* The home page contains some links and a few lines of text explaining what the app is about.
* The second page is just a test really and doesn't contain much.
* The map page contains a map showing the current location of the user.
* The Pathfinding algorithm visualisation page is for visualising how a pathfinding algorithm visits cells and ultimately chooses the best path to take.
